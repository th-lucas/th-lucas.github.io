### Hi, I'm Thomas.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I work as a Financial Software Developer in London. I have got an M.Sc. in Financial Engineering from Ensimag - Grenoble INP (France) with a strong focus on computer science and financial mathematics and a Master's degree in Quantitative Finance from IAE Grenoble (France). Professional experience, academic and personal projects helped me to gain a good grasp of software engineering in various programming languages, data analysis, manipulation and visualization and statistical techniques. I am currently looking to move to a Data Scientist position where could play with data everyday and try to draw some valuable ideas out of it.

I love spending my free time doing sports (climbing, bodyboarding, hiking, playing tennis,...), travelling and exploring the outdoors.
